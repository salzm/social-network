Social Network

## Description

This project was to demonstrate to use MongoDB and to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This Project uses express js and mongose.

## Usage

First, we had to make the files and file pathing, so I created config, controller, node_modules, modules, routes, utils, server, js and gitignore file. From there, I downloaded mongose and express js npm packages. From there, I first added code to the server js, index js in api folder, and connection js. From there, the module folder was coded index js, thoughts and user route. Once I coded it, I tested in insomnia, but my code isn't working properly. Need to rework on this.
